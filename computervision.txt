1:  I chose mediapipe because of the following benefits:

MediaPipe Pose has a pretrained, highly-accurate body-keypoint detector.
No need to train any deep learning model yourself.
It directly gives you:
Shoulder landmarks
Elbow landmarks
Hip landmarks
Wrist landmarks
33 body points with high accuracy
This saves weeks of training and testing ML models.

2: The metrics computed were:
Shoulder width change
Arm angle

4: Brief interpretation:

The task involves building a pose-estimation based analysis system using MediaPipe where a user provides 10 images. For each image, the system:
1. Detects Human Pose Landmarks
Using MediaPipe Pose, the model identifies key joints such as:
Shoulders (left & right)
Elbows
Wrists

2. Measures Shoulder Width Changes

For every image:

The X–Y coordinates of the left and right shoulder landmarks are extracted.

Euclidean distance formula is applied to compute shoulder width.

By calculating widths across 10 images, you can:

Compare width changes

Spot posture variation

Understand body rotation or camera-angle changes

3. Computes Arm Angle

The system calculates angles such as:

Upper arm angle

Forearm angle
using geometric angle formulas between:

Shoulder → Elbow → Wrist

This helps in analyzing:

Arm posture

Range of motion

Movement variations across images

4. Produces Quantitative Results

For each image, the output may include:

Shoulder width value

Arm angle value

Differences between images

A small interpretation (e.g., increased width may mean slight rotation)
